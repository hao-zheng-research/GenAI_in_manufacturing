## üìñ Overview  
This work provides:  
1. A **systematic literature review** of 107 studies (2022‚Äì2025) on GenAI in manufacturing to establish a foundation for understanding GenAI's role in manufacturing.  
2. A **5-level taxonomy** categorizing GenAI integration depth (from Conversational Assistance to Innovation Creation) to discuss rencent advancements, limitations and future endeavours of GenAI in manufacturing.  
3. A **GenAI-Driven Manufacturing Paradigm** to depict our envision for future manufacturing and spark interdisciplinary debate on this emergent topic.
